# Project Proposal

## Overview  
ContestSync is a centralized platform designed to simplify contest tracking for competitive programmers. Currently, users must visit multiple platforms—such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef—to check contest schedules. ContestSync aims to consolidate these details into a single, user-friendly dashboard to improve efficiency and reduce the time spent navigating across platforms.

## Objectives  
- Provide a unified dashboard for upcoming competitive programming contests.  
- Enable smooth user authentication via Signup and Login pages.  
- Offer a clean and responsive frontend interface.  
- Lay the groundwork for advanced features like OAuth login, filtering options, and personalized dashboards.
